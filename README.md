**Code Library** : 
This repository contains a collection of solutions for various programming problems, implemented in C, C++, and Python. It serves as a personal code library and a resource for anyone looking to practice their coding skills or find solutions to common problems.

**About This Project** : 
This project is a personal collection of code written to solve a variety of programming challenges. The problems range from simple array manipulations to more complex algorithms like graph traversal and dynamic programming. The solutions are written in different languages to demonstrate various approaches to problem-solving.

**Folder Structure** : 
The repository is organized as a flat list of files, where each file contains the solution to a specific problem. The file names are descriptive of the problem they solve.
**
How to Use** : 
To use the code in this repository, you can simply browse the files and find the solution you are interested in. You can then copy the code and adapt it to your own needs.

For example, if you are looking for a solution to the "Two Sum" problem, you can find the two_sum.cpp file and use the code as a reference.

**C++** : 

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

std::vector<int> twoSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> numMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (numMap.count(complement)) {
            return {numMap[complement], i};
        }
        numMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }
    return {};
}
**Technologies Used** : 
The solutions in this repository are implemented using the following programming languages:

C
